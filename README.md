# Getting started with Backbone and Rails

## 25 things you need to know

From my talk given at Magma Rails June 6, 2012 [slides](http://blog.leshill.org/backbone_and_rails_magma) [src](https://github.com/leshill/backbone_and_rails_magma)

An example app showing how to structure your Backbone code using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/).

## Warning: there are no tests.

You should be testing your Backbone code. I am not happy with my own testing
workflow for Backbone, so I am not going to put it up as an example. When I am
happy, I will write a blog post about it.
